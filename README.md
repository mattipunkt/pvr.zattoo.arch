# PVR Zattoo Client by rbuehlma packed for x64

In some Linux-Distros (like Arch) the Zattoo-PVR Client is not in the official repos and not in the aur. I know that Arch-users can compile their stuff for them selves, but I want to make it easier and put a compiled version here. (Most only why just not-Pro-People use Manjaro and they can't get the Zattoo-Addon without self-building.)
